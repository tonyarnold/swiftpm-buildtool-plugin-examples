# Example 5 - SwiftLint

This example uses a build tool plugin to execute [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) on the target's source code.

This example requires SwiftPM 5.6 or later.

NOTE: There seems to be a bug in SwiftPM 5.6 and Xcode 13.3 that causes the `swiftlint` tool to not be found.
